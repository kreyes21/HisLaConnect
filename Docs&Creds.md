### Link to Prototype
IMPORTANT NOTICE: Although the prototype is compatible with mobile applications, it is recommended that you use the app on a computer, desktop or laptop of some kind for the best experience. We also recommend that you use the "Fit to Screen" feature in Figma. How to achieve fit to screen? Options > Fit to Screen or click Z on your keyboard.
