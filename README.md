## What you should know
- HisLa Connect is meant to be a hub of resources for Hispanic and Latino adults in New York who are looking for resources to expand in their careers.
- This is a prototype of an app that the Product Owner, [Kayla Reyes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaylaereyes/), hopes to expand upon in the future.
- The app was made entirely using Figma during the duration of Fellowship under the Girls Who Code Leadership Academy.

### Below is a series of questions provided by the Leadership Academy to brainstorm different aspects of the Project. 

### [Rationale] Why this project?
*We are hoping to provide a resource hub for Hispanic and Latino Communities. We aim to create a space that will allow them to bridge connections and networking opportunities with other individuals who may currently be involved in their preferred industries. This project is especially important to the product owner, Kayla Reyes, as she hopes to inspire more conversations, resources and opportunities to bring Hispanic and Latino communities together.*

### [Problem/Opportunity Statement] What problem/challenge does this project address? How does the project address this problem?
*We plan to address the lack of visibility these Hispanic and Latino resources have to reaching this said demographic. This would be a toolkit, directory, or a type of platform that would house various assets and opportunities can be used to thrive in their desired career paths.*

### [Goal] What are the specific intended outcomes for this project? How will the success of this project be measured?
*The success of this project will be measured by the surplus of outreach and networking between Hispanic and Latino communities. Since we are targetting a specific demographic, we hope to gain support from other pre-existing programs and communities who share the same mission as we do, should this flourish outside of our prototype.*

### [Scope] How many people do you think this project will impact? How will people be impacted by this project?
*The Hispanic and Latino communities in New York are the targetted audience, but this can be expanded to more. From young adults to elderlies, this tool can be utilized to gain resourceful awareness and create a transition to various career paths no matter what stage they are at in their lives.*

### [Key Requirements] What do you need to execute this project?
*We may need funding for the project collaboration features on certain applications. We've already scheduled times to meet before and outside of our cohort meeting sessions so time delegation wont be much of an issue. Otherwise we are adapting to the apps we are using or plan to use. EDIT 10/02/2023: We are using Figma student for this project in order to utilize it's full capabilites. We used Girls Who Code Program logistics to get it approved. Our meetings are pre-scheduled not only through our timeline but google calandar. We plan on updating the agenda once per week with tasks updated every meeting for flexiblility.*

### [Known Constraints/Risks] What challenges do you anticipate? Where would the project go wrong, and how can you address that before getting started?
*The challenges that are anticipated are finding local and national resources to provide for communities and the complexities of working with an unfamiliar platform. We can address these problems by researching early and diving deep and scheduling time to learn figma through the use of in-depth workshops. We plan to stay on schedule and maintain a positive outlook on all stages of the project.*
