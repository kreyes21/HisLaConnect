## Hidden Surprises/"Easter Eggs" within HisLa Connect

As the title might provide insight, there are some fun surprises in HisLa Connect. If you missed them however, then you can use this page as a guide to assist you should you choose to re-traverse the application!

*If you are seeing this first, please head over to [README.md](https://github.com/kreyes21/HisLaConnect) first

### Start Page Hones Many Ways You Can Connect!
Once you enter the start page, we have already scattered the page with fun surprises. Once you click on a non clickable function in the app however, they become less of a surprise.

1. Click on the **Calendar App Icon** to connect with our team's Product Owner, Project Manager & Lead Developer, Kayla!
2. Click on the **Mail App Icon** to connect with our team's UX/UI Designer, Morgan!
3. Click on the **Music App Icon** to connect with our team's Business Analyst, Evelyn!
4. Click on the **Photos App Icon** to connect with our team's Full-Stack Developer, Ariadna!
5. Click on the **Girls Who Code Widget** to reach the official Girls Who Code page!

### Always Here to Support you :)
While you traverse the app, it's not certain that you'd catch this one. However, if you look over to the **Setting page**, right in between *Update* and *Log Out* you will see **Have any questions? Contact Support.**
If you click on it, you will find that it leads you to Kayla's Linkedin! This was a funny idea the team agreed to have in the application.
